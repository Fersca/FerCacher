Jcached. - Last update: March 13th, 2012.

This is a super-simple Key-value cache written in plain java.
Put, Delete and Get elements in constant-time.

Version 0.1:

- Multi-Thread connections listening at port 5555.
- Store only strings (only for now)
- Implements a LRU Double-Linked Queue to delete old elements. Direct access to the Queue instead of typical full scan.

Help wanted!
- To improve synchronization, today synchronized methods are used but they can be improved for sure.
- To Implements a thread pool for incomming the connections.
- To download/restore the cache values to disk.
- To write a java client.
- To create test for test conrurrency
- To etc.
